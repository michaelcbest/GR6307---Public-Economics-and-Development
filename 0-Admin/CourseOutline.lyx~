 Meetings are 20 mins long, so please come prepared.
 Meeting slots tend to fill up so if you want to talk about something with
 a specific deadline (an upcoming colloquium presentation, or an assignment
 for class) you need to plan ahead, it's very hard for me to add extra slots
 at the last minute.

\begin_layout Section
Course Description and Objectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This course covers a range of challenges faced by governments in low- and
 middle-income countries.
 The course will cover both applied theory papers and empirical papers applying
 the latest empirical methods.
 We will cover four broad topics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Applied Welfare Analysis: We'll start with a little bit of tooling up on
 the theory behind modern applied welfare analysis.
 We'll cover the sufficient statistics approach and the measurement of marginal
 welfare impacts of policy changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Taxation: Tax systems in rich countries look very different from those in
 poor countries.
 How should tax systems be designed in the presence of high levels of tax
 evasion and informality? How much tax evasion is there? How can governments
 reduce tax evasion? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Anti-Poverty Programs: Targeted transfers to poor household are a huge part
 of government spending in low- and middle-income countries.
 How should these programs be designed? Should they be monetary or in-kind
 transfers? Should they be means-tested? If so, how will eligibility be
 determined? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Personnel Economics of the State: The government is the largest employer
 in most countries, but public service delivery is notoriously inefficient.
 How can governments attract honest, capable and motivated workers? How
 will the government monitor and incentivize their workers? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Course Materials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am publishing all the course materials in a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "github"
target "https://github.com/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 repository: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

target "https://github.com/michaelcbest/GR6307---Public-Economics-and-Developmenthttps://github.com/michaelcbest/GR6307---Public-Economics-and-Development"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The folder contains both pdfs and source code for all the materials.
 The folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 contains this course outline as well as the reading list (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GR 6307 - Syllabus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 I will be updating the materials as we go, so make sure to check back regularly
 to see if there are updates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the syllabus, I will mark the absolutely required readings with two stars
 (**).
 Each week, there will also be a reading with one star and the date (*M/DD).
 Each week, you are required to prepare 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 6-slide (excluding the title slide) discussion of this papers and bring
 it with you to class on a USB drive.
 The model here is to imagine you are discussing the paper at a conference.
 So you should spend 1-3 slides summarizing the main findings of the paper,
 but assume everyone else has read it, so highlight only things you find
 particularly interesting and worth discussing more.
 Then use your remaining slides to make 2-3 points about the paper that
 are things you think could be done even better.
 Try and be constructive, it's easy to point out flaws in papers, it's much
 more difficult, but much more useful, to think of ways to do things better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will randomly call on someone to present their discussion each week, and
 then we'll discuss the paper as a group.
 NB the randomization will be with replacement, so don't think that you
 can't be called more than once!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm sure there are typos in my slides.
 If you spot one, please point it out.
 Or even better, fix it and send me a pull request! If you're unfamiliar
 with github and version control, you can learn more about it here: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

.
 It's a great tool, especially for collaborative projects (basically every
 tech product you use is built using this).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A referee report includes two items: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An anonymous report which briefly summarizes the key contributions of the
 paper and then discusses constructively the main issues with the paper
 (why some assumptions or arguments are not convincing or clearly presented,
 how the paper could be improved).
 The length of this report should be between 2 or 3 pages of typed text,
 12 pt font, and 1.5 line spacing.
 I will share your reports with the authors, since they could be helpful
 to them as they revise the papers for submission.
 Therefore, please

 be published.
 The recommendation should be briefly justified (the length of the letter
 should be between 10 and 15 lines of typed text).

\begin_layout Section
Replication Exercise
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Replication-Exercise"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is for you to get your hands dirty with some real data to
 do two things.
 First, to play with the data but with the reassurance of knowing what the
 answer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

should
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 be when you run a certain regression so you don't need to agonize about
 all the decisions you made to get there.
 Second, to see how many agonizing decisions go into producing the small
 number of tables/figures you see in a finished paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this, go through our syllabus and pick a paper to try and replicate
 (you can also pick another paper on a related topic, but check with me
 first please).
 Most recent papers also post replication data/code on the authors' websites,
 the journal's website or both.
 Download the replication code and data.
 There will be a readme file that explains what all the pieces of code and
 data are and how to use them to replicate the paper's results.
 Read this first, before you start playing with the code and data, it will
 save you time.
 Run the code to replicate the paper's results.
 Double-check you get the same thing as in the paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, prepare a replication report in which you detail 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Where you got the code/data from and what issues, if any, you had in replicating
 the paper's findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One interesting robustness check.
 For example, this can be robustness to the criteria used to build the sample
 that's used for analysis.
 Many decisions fo into constructing the sample that's used for the analysis,
 how robust are the findings to making other sensible choices? How sensible
 are the choices that the paper makes? Or it could be robustness to statistical
 methods.
 For example using logit instead of a linear probability model, or using
 randomization inference instead of asymptotic standard errors.
 What are the advantages and weaknesses of the methods used in the paper
 versus other possibilities? Or it could be robustness to adding additional
 controls (or removing controls you suspect could be bad controls).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One interesting extension.
 Do some new analysis with this data.
 Does the model in the paper have an additional prediction you can test?
 Can you write a model that delivers an additional prediction you can test?
 Can you bring in additional data that allows you to test additional predictions
 to get at mechanisms? Is there a subsequent paper whose findings should
 replicate in this sample? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A summary of what you learned from the exercise.
 Reflect on how this exercise will change the way you approach analyzing
 data in your own research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report will be due on 3/8.
 Please upload the report in courseworks as a pdf by 5pm

Data Exercise
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Data-Exercise"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea here is for you to work on a data-based project that is a bit less
 structured than a replication, but where you still have a bit of guidance
 on how to proceed.
 That is, there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 answer to the problem, but you have a concrete starting point and direction.
 For this exercise, please do one of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
MVPF.
 The team at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Policy Impacts"
target "https://www.policyimpacts.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are building a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "library of policies"
target "https://www.policyimpacts.org/policy-impacts-library"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for which good research can allow us to estimate an MVPF.
 Look through the policies for which they already have an MVPF and then
 generate a new estimate of the MVPF of an interesting policy.
 This can be either using different estimates than those used for a policy
 that is in their library, or for a new policy that isn't in their library.
 You don't necessarily have to produce all the estimates yourself, you can
 pull together estimates from existing work and incorporate them into the
 MVPF framework.
 Then, you can submit it to the team to be included in their library: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

 Use this data to do something interesting.
 This doesn't have to have cast-iron identification, interesting descriptive
 work is still very interesting as long as you are clear about what we can
 and cannot learn.
 You might want to try merging this data with other data sources.

\begin_layout Standard
The assignment here is not to finish a paper, it is to have a viable plan
 for a paper.
 I'd rather that you get 50% of the way toward a project that you're excited
 to continue after the semester finishes than that you complete a less ambitious
 paper in the timeframe of one semester.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will formulate an original research idea, develop a practical plan for
 executing the idea, and take initial steps in the execution.
 The paper may take the following form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Introduction: What is the specific question and why is the question of interest?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Literature Review/ Contribution: How does your paper fit into the broader
 literature? What is the potential contribution of this paper relative to
 the existing literature? What do we learn about the world that we didn’t
 know before your paper? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Theoretical Motivation: This could be actual theory or just a sketch of
 the relevant theory that underlies your question.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data: What data would you use to answer/address this question? Why are the
 data well suited to the question? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Empirical Methodology: How would you use the data to answer your question?
 Be explicit about identification and causality, keeping in mind that the
 same set of empirical facts can often support many theories.
 Depending on the nature of your question and the ease of accessing and
 using the data, I may ask you to make significant progress in the actual
 implementation of your proposed empirical work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Falsification Tests: What other specifications, tests and investigations
 could either bolster or cast doubt upon the primary tests of your hypotheses?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preliminary Results: The extent of the results provided will differ across
 students based on the project and discussions with me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper will be due on 5/10.
